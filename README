# 📊 Eth-Bank Apps Sentiment Analysis


*Actionable customer-experience insights for three leading Ethiopian banks, powered by NLP, interactive dashboards & a zero-config SQLite data-lake.*

---

## 🚀 What is this?

This repository ingests **Google Play** reviews for the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Bank of Abyssinia (BOA) and Dashen Bank, cleans and enriches them with:

* **Sentiment scores** (DistilBERT + AfriBERTa ensemble)
* **Business themes** (8 pain-point categories)
* **Interactive visualisations** (Plotly + Streamlit)
* **Recommendations** per bank based on top negative drivers

All raw & processed data are written to a lightweight **SQLite** database (`bank_reviews.db`) so you can explore the full dataset with nothing more than Python ☕
